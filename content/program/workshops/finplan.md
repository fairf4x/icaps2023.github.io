# Planning and Scheduling for Financial Services (FinPlan'23)

ICAPS'23 Workshop
Prague, Czech Republic
July 9-10, 2023

## Aim and Scope of the Workshop

Planning and scheduling are mature fields in terms of base techniques and algorithms to solve goal-oriented tasks. Planning approaches have been successfully applied to many domains including classical domains (e.g., logistics and Mars rovers) and, more recently, in oil and gas as well as mining industries. Similarly, scheduling approaches have also been applied to many industrial applications. However, very little work has been done in relation to the problems in the finance industry, which spans a diverse range of activities in financial markets, corporate finance, insurance, banking, and accounting. Recently, some large financial corporations have started AI research labs and researchers at those teams have found that there are plenty of open planning and scheduling problems to be tackled by the ICAPS community. For example, these include trading markets, workflow learning, generation and execution, transactions flow understanding, fraud detection, and customer journeys. In addition, planning problems tackled in other settings like dialog management and network penetration; and richer problem formations involving planning along with learning and scheduling, would also be relevant here.

## Topics of Interest

The workshop includes - but is not limited to - the following topics:
- planning and scheduling in trading and markets
- process mining of organizational workflows
- planning, execution and simulation of organizational processes
- explainable planning for financial applications
- goal reasoning in the context of financial services
- goal and plan recognition from customers behavior or transactions history
- human-AI teaming in organizational processes
- plan similarity and plan diversity
- anomaly detection using planning techniques
- planning with unstructured information
- plan visualization and explanations for finance
- applications of planning, learning and scheduling in financial organizations
- use cases, datasets, benchmarks and applications of planning for financial services
- links between planning and other disciplines related to finance (e.g., behavioral economics, econometry, markets, ...)

## Important Dates

- Submission deadline [EXTENDED]: April 4, 2023
- Notification of acceptance/rejection: April 28, 2023
- Camera-ready upload: May 12, 2023
