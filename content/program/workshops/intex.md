# IntEx: Integrated Acting, Planning and Execution

ICAPS'23 Workshop \
Prague, Czech Republic \
July 9, 2023

## Aim and Scope of the Workshop

Automated planners are increasingly being integrated into online acting systems. The integration may, for example, embed a domain-independent temporal planner in a manufacturing system  (e.g., the Xerox printer application) or autonomous vehicles  (e.g., a planetary rover or anunderwater glider). The integration may resemble something more like an "acting and planning stack" where an automated planner produces an activity or  task plan that is further refined by an actor before being executed  by the execution platform of the actor, such as, a reactive  controller (e.g., robotics). Or the integration may be a  domain-specific policy that maps states to actions  (e.g., reinforcement learning). Models for planning and execution can be same or different; the planning model can define 
context-dependent actions schema for online (re-)planning  or can just specify flexibility to be handled separately at  execution time. Online learning may or may not be involved,  and may include adjusting or augmenting the model, determining  when to repair versus replan, learning to switch policies, etc.  A specific focus of these integrations involves online deliberation and managing the execution of actions, bringing to the foreground  concerns over how much computational effort planning should invest over time.

In any of these systems, a planner generates action sequences that  are eventually dispatched to an executive, yet taking action in a  dynamic world rarely proceeds according to plan. When planning  assumptions are challenged during execution, or some dynamic  events occur, it raises a number of interesting questions about how  the system should respond and which is the scope of online  deliberation versus execution. Is the "acting" side of the  system responsible for a response or the "planning" side? Or do the  two need to cooperate and how much? When should the activity planner  abandon or preempt the current goals? Should the task planner repair a plan or replan from scratch? Should the executive adjust its  current policy, switch to a new one, or learn a new policy from more relevant experience?

The seventh edition of the workshop on  Integrated Planning, Acting, and Execution (IntEx) aims: (1) to provide a forum for discussing the challenges of integrating online planning, acting, and execution, and (2) to assess the potential for holding an integrated execution competition at ICAPS.

<!-- <h5>Short Description</h5> -->

<p>
Dynamic Targeting (DT) is an emerging concept in which data from a lookahead instrument is
used to rapidly intelligently reconfigure and point a primary instrument to enhance science
return. For example, in the Smart Ice Hunting Radar (SMICES) a forward-looking radiometer is
used to detect deep convective ice storms which are then targeted using a radar. In other
concepts, forward-looking sensors are used to detect clouds so that a primary sensor can avoid
them. To this end, we have developed several algorithms from Operations Research and
Artificial Intelligence/heuristic search to point/reconfigure the dynamic instrument. We present
simulation studies of DT for these concepts and benchmark these algorithms to show that DT is
a powerful tool with the potential to significantly improve instrument science yield. We will also
discuss plans to fly dynamic targeting.</p>
