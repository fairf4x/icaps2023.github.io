The deadline for **early registration is May 5, 2023** and the **late registration deadline is July 5, 2023**.

## Information for Authors

Each paper accepted to the main conference program (AAAI proceedings) must be accompanied by registration and payment of either regular fee or student fee. It is up to the authors to decide who will be the presenter and will pay the registration fee (that author will need to **include EasyChair submission ID** during the registration). **One registration fee includes up to 2 papers**; each extra paper by the same author requires additional fee (see Optional fees below).

Physical attendance and in-person presentation is expected for each paper. In extraordinary cases, on-line presentation will be allowed. In such a case, the author needs to provide a valid reason and get approval from conference chairs. This still requires regular/student registration fee for the paper (on-line fee does not include any paper).
